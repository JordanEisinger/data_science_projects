# Hello! Welcome to my Data Science (DS) Repository! 👋🏻

This repo is full of fun and interesting DS projects that I work on in my free time 😄

- *Every project in this repo is a replication of a project(s) I have found online (Medium, Toward Data Science, etc.)*
- *A future goal is to add my own original projects to this repo (or create a new one)...stay tuned for updates!*

Each folder is labeled according to the primary language used in the project:

- *"PP#" --> Python Project*
- *"JP#" --> Java Project*
- *"MP" --> Markdown Project*

## Current projects in this repo
