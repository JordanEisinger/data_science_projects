## Hello! Welcome to my Data Science (DS) Repository! 👋🏻

This repo is full of fun and interesting DS projects that I work on in my free time 😄
For right now, these are all replication of projects I have found online.

#### Little About Me:
- 💼 I work as a Data Scientist for an online dating website 💕
- 🌱 Currently learning a bit of everything!
- 🎸 When I'm not doing data things, I play guitar in a rock band!
- 🗓 2022 Goal: I'm new to GitHub, so my goal for the remainder of 2022 is to learn as much as I can!
