## Hello! Welcome to my Data Science (DS) Repository! 👋🏻

This repo is full of fun and interesting DS projects that I work on in my free time 😄
<br/>
- *Every project in this repo is a replication of a project(s) I have found online (Medium, Toward Data Science, etc.)*
- *A future goal is to add my own original projects to this repo (or create a new one)...stay tuned for updates!*
<br/>

Each folder is labeled according to the primary language used in the project:
- *"PP#" --> Python Project*
- *"JP#" --> Java Project*
- *"MP" --> Markdown Project*

#### About Me:
- 💼 I work as a Data Scientist for an online dating website 💕
- 🌱 Currently learning a bit of everything!
- 🎸 When I'm not doing data things, I play guitar in a rock band!
- 🗓 2022 Goal: I'm new to GitHub, so my goal for the remainder of 2022 is to learn as much as I can!
