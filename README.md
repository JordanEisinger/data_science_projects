## Hello! I'm Jordan and welcome to my Data Science (DS) Repository! 👋🏻

This is a repo for fun python DS projects that I  work on in my free time. 😄 

- 💼 I work as a Data Scientist for an online dating company 
- 🌱 Currently learning a bit of everything!
- 🎸 When I'm not analysing data, I play guitar in a rock band!
- 🗓 2021 Goal: I'm new to GitHub, so my goal for the remainder of 2020 is to learn as much as I can going into 2022!
